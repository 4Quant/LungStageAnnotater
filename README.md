# LungStage Annotator
This tool is designed to facilitate the annotation of PETCT data. The tool is based on 3D Slicer and streamlines much of the steps to make manual segmentation much quicker and more consistent.

A video demonstrating the tool and how it works is [available](LungStageAnnotator)

## Standard Annotation
The standard annotation tools for 3D Slicer are all public and open source. A quick tutorial for PETCT is also [available](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLor6_v5dt2SjdX-jds-OshNKHhehJOmov)
